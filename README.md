*   **Modern UI**: Responsive, dark-themed interface built with Vanilla JS and CSS.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Backend**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Pydantic v2
*   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
*   **AI Engine**: Ollama (Recommended models: `deepseek-r1:1.5b`, `llama3`, `mistral`)
*   **Search**: DuckDuckGo + Invidious (for resource discovery)

## 👩‍💻 Developers

Want to integrate this into your own app? Check out the [Integration Guide](integration_guide.md) for full architecture details and API examples.

Integration Guide: AI Course Generator
This guide details how to integrate the AI Course Generator feature into your existing application. The system is designed as a standalone microservice (FastAPI) that your main application can query to generate structured learning content.

🏗️ Architecture
The feature consists of three layers:

AI Provider (Ollama): Local LLM inference engine.
Backend Service (Python/FastAPI): Orchestrates prompts, validates JSON, and enriches content with resources.
Frontend Layer: Your application's UI that consumes the backend API.

🔌 API Reference
Base URL: http://localhost:8000
1. Generate Course Outline (Phase 1)
Endpoint: POST /api/generate/outline
Description: Generates a high-level weekly schedule (4-24 weeks) based on goal complexity.
Request:

json
{
  "goal": "Master React Native",
  "model": "deepseek-r1:1.5b"
}
Response:

json
{
  "title": "React Native Mastery",

      "title": "Environment Setup & Basics",
      "concepts": ["Expo", "CLI", "Components"],
      "focus": "theory"
    }
  ]
}
2. Generate Day Details (Phase 2 - Lazy Load)

  ]
}
🧩 Integration Steps
Step 1: Backend Setup
Copy the backend folder to your project services directory. Ensure strict isolation of Python dependencies (v3.11+).

Key Files:

main.py
: Entry point.
course_generator.py
: Core logic for prompting and prompt engineering.
ai_providers.py
: Handles Ollama communication and JSON Repair.
Step 2: Prompt Engineering
The prompts are located in 
backend/course_generator.py
.

OUTLINE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE: Controls the course structure and duration logic.
DAY_DETAILS_PROMPT_TEMPLATE: Controls the depth of daily content and valid resource queries.
Step 3: JSON Repair Logic
The system includes a robust JSON repair engine in 
backend/ai_providers.py
 to handle truncated responses from small models.

Auto-closing strings: Handles cut-off text values.
Auto-closing brackets: Balances { and [ nesting.
Think-tag removal: Strips <think> blocks from reasoning models.
Step 4: Frontend Implementation
Your UI should implement Lazy Loading:

Call /api/generate/outline to get the timeline.
Render the timeline visually (weeks/months).
When a user expands a day, show a loading spinner and call /api/generate/day.
Render the returned 
resources
 (YouTube videos) prominently.
🎨 Customization
Change Duration: Edit RULES in OUTLINE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE to enforce fixed lengths (e.g. "Always 12 weeks").
Change Resources: Modify 
enrich_with_resources
 in 
resource_search.py
 to add documentation providers (MDN, StackOverflow).
